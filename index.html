      <p class="bt-section-subtitle">
        More than a strain list. Buzz Tracker helps you connect the dots between
        <strong>what you smoke</strong> and <strong>how you feel</strong>.

          <h3>📝 Simple Buzz Logs</h3>
          <p>
            Pick your strain, log your session, and slide a few sliders for things like
            pain relief, anxiety relief, couch-lock, focus, and mood. It feels more like
            a quick check-in than homework.

          <h3>🧬 Terpene-aware, not just strain names</h3>
          <p>
            Buzz Tracker doesn’t stop at “Hybrid” or a catchy strain name. It looks at the
            <strong>terpene profile</strong> so you can see patterns like “Limonene + Caryophyllene
            usually help my mood and pain.”

        <div class="bt-card">
          <h3>📊 Personal insights & reports</h3>
          <p>
            Over time, your log history turns into reports: your top strains for pain relief,
            the terpenes that show up when your anxiety scores drop, and which products
            just don’t work for you.

          <h3>📷 Label Scanner</h3>
          <p>
            Buzz Tracker's Label Scanner can often ID your Strain once 
            scanned. However, if your label doesn't scan, Buzz Tracker 
            gives you the oppotunity to Add your own strain so that 
            you don't miss out on logging any of your Buzzes.

      <h2 class="bt-section-title">What are terpenes, and why should you care?</h2>
      <p class="bt-section-subtitle">
        Terpenes are aromatic compounds found in cannabis (and lots of other plants) that
        contribute to <strong>how a strain actually feels</strong> – not just how it smells.
      </p>

      <div class="bt-terp-grid">
        <article class="bt-terp-card">
          <h3>Limonene 🍋</h3>
          <p>
            Often associated with uplifted mood, energy, and a brighter headspace.
            Common in “daytime” strains and citrus-smelling flower.

          <h3>Pinene 🌲</h3>
          <p>
            Found in pine trees and some cannabis strains, pinene is often tied to alertness

          <div>
            <h3>Log your session</h3>
            <p>
              Open Buzz Tracker, pick your strain (or add a new one), and quickly rate
              the effects you care about: pain relief, anxiety, sleep, focus, etc.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>Let the app track the details</h3>
            <p>
              Each log is connected to terpene data, THC range, and strain type.
              You don’t have to be a scientist – the app keeps track of the nerdy stuff for you.

          <div>
            <h3>See patterns & recommendations</h3>
            <p>
              Over time, you’ll see patterns like “linalool + myrcene = great sleep nights”
              or “these three strains don’t help my anxiety at all.” Use that to choose
              better products next time you visit a dispensary.
