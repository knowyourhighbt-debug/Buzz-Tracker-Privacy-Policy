    <h1>BuzzTracker – Terms of Service</h1>

    <p>Last Updated: January 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By downloading or using the BuzzTracker app (“the App”), you agree to be bound by these
      Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Purpose of the App</h2>
    <p>
      BuzzTracker is a cannabis strain tracking and educational tool. It allows users to log
      personal experiences, view terpene information, and scan labels when available.
      BuzzTracker does <strong>not</strong> provide medical advice, legal advice, or professional guidance.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Age Requirement</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 18 years old, or the legal minimum cannabis-related age in your region,
      to use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>4. No Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>
      Information in the App is for educational purposes only. Cannabis affects individuals
      differently, and terpene/THC data can vary by batch and grower.
      Always consult a licensed healthcare professional regarding medical or health questions.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Data & Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your use of the App is also governed by our
      <a href="https://thebuzztracker.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>,
      which explains how data is collected and used.
    </p>

    <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Users agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use BuzzTracker for illegal activities.</li>
      <li>Upload harmful, offensive, or inaccurate content.</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, copy, resell, or misuse the App.</li>
      <li>Bypass subscription requirements or attempt unauthorized access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Accuracy of Information</h2>
    <p>
      While BuzzTracker strives for accuracy, we do not guarantee that strain names, terpene
      profiles, THC percentages, or COA interpretations are error-free. Users should confirm all
      information with official laboratory COAs.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Paid features in the App may be offered through Apple or Google’s in-app purchase systems.
      Refunds must follow each platform’s refund policies. We do not process refunds directly.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      BuzzTracker and its developers shall not be liable for any damages resulting from the use of
      the App, including but not limited to health decisions, legal consequences, inaccurate data,
      or misuse of the App.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App means you agree to the
      revised Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Contact Information</h2>
